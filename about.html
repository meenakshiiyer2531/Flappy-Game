        <h1>About Flappy Bird</h1>
        <p>
            Flappy Bird is a fun, addictive game where the player controls a small bird, trying to fly through a series of pipes without hitting them. Originally developed by Vietnamese game developer Dong Nguyen, the game became a viral sensation for its simple yet challenging mechanics.
        </p>

        <h2>The Origins</h2>
        <p>
            Flappy Bird was released in May 2013 but gained massive popularity in early 2014. Its retro-styled 8-bit graphics and straightforward gameplay hark back to the golden days of arcade games. Despite its simplicity, it quickly captivated millions of players worldwide.
        </p>

        <h2>Gameplay Mechanics</h2>
        <p>
            The player taps the screen to make the bird "flap" its wings and stay airborne. Timing and precision are key, as the player must navigate the bird through randomly spaced pipes. Each successful passage between pipes earns a point, with the goal of achieving the highest score possible.
        </p>

        <h2>Why is it So Addictive?</h2>
        <p>
            Flappy Bird is infamous for being both frustrating and addictive. The core challenge lies in its deceptively simple controls that require precise timing and concentration. The difficulty ramps up quickly, which often leads players to try "just one more time" to beat their previous score.
